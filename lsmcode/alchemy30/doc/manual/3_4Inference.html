<H2><A NAME="SECTION00034000000000000000">
3.4 Inference</A>
</H2>
To perform inference, run the <TT>infer</TT> executable, 
e.g., <TT>ALCHDIR/bin/infer -i univ-out.mln -e univ-test.db
-r univ.results -q advisedBy,student,professor -c -p -mcmcMaxSteps 20000</TT>. 

<P>
<TT>-i</TT> specifies the input <TT>.mln</TT> file. In that file all formulas 
must be preceded by a weight or terminated by a period (but not both).
An exception is a unit formula with variables followed by the <TT>!</TT> 
operator. Such a unit formula can be preceded by a weight, or terminated 
by a period, or neither. (For such a unit formula,  the code automatically 
creates formulas stating that the variables have mutually exclusive and 
exhaustive values. See Section&nbsp;<A HREF="4Syntax.html#syntax">4</A>.)
Each formula in the input <TT>.mln</TT> file is converted to CNF. 
If a weight precedes the formula, it is divided equally among 
its CNF clauses.  
If the formula is terminated by a period (i.e., the formula is hard), 
each of its CNF clauses is given a default weight that is twice the maximum 
soft clause weight.
If neither weight nor period is specified for a unit formula with  
variables followed by <TT>!</TT>, each of its CNF clauses is given 
a default weight that is 1.5 times the maximum soft clause weight.
(See the developer's manual on how to change the default weights.)

<P>
<TT>-e</TT> specifies the evidence <TT>.db</TT> file; a comma-separated list 
can be used to specify more than one <TT>.db</TT> file. 
<TT>-r</TT> specifies the output file which contains the inference results. 

<P>
<TT>-q</TT> specifies the query predicates. 
You can specify more than one query predicate, and restrict the query to 
particular groundings, e.g., <TT>-q advisedBy(x,Ida),advisedBy(Ida,Geri)</TT>. 
(Depending on the shell you are using, you may have to enclose the query 
predicates in quotes because of the presence of parentheses.) You can 
also use the <TT>-f</TT> option to specify a file 
(same format as a <TT>.db</TT> file without false and unknown atoms) 
containing the query ground atoms you are interested in. 
(You may use both <TT>-q</TT> and <TT>-f</TT> together.)

<P>
An evidence predicate is defined as a predicate of which the .db evidence
file contains at least one grounding; all evidence predicates are
closed-world by default. All non-evidence predicates are open-world by
default. The user may specify that some evidence predicates are open-world
by listing them with the -o option. Also, the user may specify that some
non-evidence predicates are closed-world by listing them with the -c option.
This effectively turns them into evidence predicates with all false groundings.
If a ground atom is listed as a query atom on the command line or in
the query file, or is specified as unknown in the evidence file,
this overrides any closed-world defaults or options. If a
first-order predicate is listed as a query predicate and the
evidence file contains at least one of its groundings, the predicate
is open-world. In other words, the openness of query predicates
overrides the closedness of evidence ones. If a predicate is
simultaneously listed as a query predicate and as closed-world with
the -c option, or appears in both -c and -o lists, an error message
is returned to the user. If a predicate is closed-world and some of
its atoms are query atoms, the predicate is treated as closed-world
except for the query atoms. If the user specifies an evidence
predicate as closed with the -c option or a non-evidence one as open
with -o, a warning message is returned, as these are the defaults.
Type <TT>ALCHDIR/bin/infer</TT> without any parameters to see all
available options.

<P>
Alchemy supports two basic types of inference:&nbsp;MCMC and MAP/MPE. The current
implementation contains three MCMC algorithms: Gibbs sampling (option <TT>-p</TT>),
MC-SAT&nbsp;[<A
 HREF="Bibliography.html#poon_SPMamp_domingos06">6</A>] (option <TT>-ms</TT>) and simulated
tempering&nbsp;[<A
 HREF="Bibliography.html#marinari_SPMamp_parisi92">5</A>] (option <TT>-simtp</TT>). When MCMC inference is run,
the probabilities that the query atoms are true are written to the
output file specified. <TT>-mcmcMaxSteps</TT> is used to specify the maximum
number of steps in the MCMC algorithm. 

<P>
To use MAP inference instead, specify either the 
<TT>-m</TT> or <TT>-a</TT> option. The former only returns the true ground atoms, 
while the latter returns both true and false ones. For MAP inference, 
the output file also contains the weight assigned to a hard ground 
clause, fraction of hard ground clauses that are satisfied, the sum 
of their weights, and the sum of the weights of satisfied soft ground 
clauses. During MAP inference, each hard clause (derived from a hard 
formula with a terminating period) is given a weight that is the sum 
of the soft clause weights plus 10.

<P>
The MAP inference engine used in Alchemy attempts to satisfy clauses with
positive weights (just as in the original MaxWalkSat algorithm) and keep
clauses with negative weights unsatisfied. As an extension to the MaxWalkSat
algorithm, when a clause with a negative weight is chosen to fix, one true
atom in that clause is chosen at random to be set to false.
