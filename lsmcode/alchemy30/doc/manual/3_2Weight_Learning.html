3.2 Weight Learning</A>
</H2>
To learn the weights of formulas, run the <TT>learnwts</TT> executable, e.g.,
<TT>ALCHDIR/bin/learnwts -g -i univ.mln -o univ-out.mln -t univ-train.db</TT>.
<TT>-g</TT> specifies that generative learning is to be used. Alternatively, 
you can use <TT>-d</TT> for discriminative learning, e.g., 
<TT>ALCHDIR/bin/learnwts -d -i univ.mln -o univ-out.mln -t univ-train.db 
-ne advisedBy,student,professor</TT>.
<TT>-i</TT> and <TT>-o</TT> specify the input and 
output <TT>.mln</TT> files as <TT>univ.mln</TT> and <TT>univ-out.mln</TT> respectively.

<P>
<TT>-t</TT> specifies the <TT>.db</TT> file that is to be used by weight learning. 
You can specify more than one <TT>.db</TT> file after <TT>-t</TT> in a comma 
separated list (e.g., <TT>-t univ1.db,univ2.db</TT>). The universe of 
constants are those that appear in the <TT>.db</TT> files. By default, all the 
constants are assumed to belong to one database. If this is not the 
case, you can use the option <TT>-multipleDatabases</TT> to specify that the 
constants in each <TT>.db</TT> file belong to a separate database, 
and should not be mixed with those in other <TT>.db</TT> files 
(e.g, <TT>-t ai.db,graphics.db,systems.db -multipleDatabases</TT>).

<P>
In the current version of Alchemy <TT>.db</TT> files that are used for learning 
can only contain true or false atoms (no unknowns). If there are 
constants that do not appear in the <TT>.db</TT> files, you can specify one 
or more <TT>.mln</TT> files containing the missing constants, and append them 
after the input <TT>.mln</TT> file, e.g., <TT>-i univ.mln,univ-train.mln</TT>. 
(You may wish to specify the extra <TT>.mln</TT> files when there are constants 
that only appear in false ground atoms of a closed-world predicate, 
or only in unknown ground atoms of an open world predicate. Such ground 
atoms need not be defined in <TT>.db</TT> files.) By default, unit clauses for 
all predicates are added to the MLN during weight learning. (You can 
change this with the <TT>-noAddUnitClauses</TT> option.) 

<P>
The <TT>-ne</TT> option is used to specify non-evidence predicates. 
For discriminative learning, at least one non-evidence predicate must 
be specified. For generative learning, the specified predicates are 
included in the (weighted) pseudo-log-likelihood computation; 
if none are specified, all are included.

<P>
During weight learning, each formula is converted to conjunctive 
normal form (CNF), and a weight is learned for each of its clauses.
If a formula is preceded by a weight in the input <TT>.mln</TT> file, 
the weight is divided equally among the formula's clauses. 
The weight of a clause is used as the mean of a Gaussian prior 
for the learned weight. If a formula is terminated by a period 
(i.e., the formula is a hard one), each of the clauses in 
its CNF is given a prior weight that is twice the maximum of the soft 
clause weights. If neither a weight nor a period is specified, a default 
prior weight is used for each of the formula's clauses; you can specify 
a default with the <TT>-priorMean</TT> option. 
If a unit formula contains variables that are followed by the <TT>!</TT> 
operator, the code automatically creates formulas stating that the 
variables have mutually exclusive and exhaustive values 
(see Section&nbsp;<A HREF="4Syntax.html#syntax">4</A>). 
The default prior weight for each clause in the CNF of those formulas 
is 1.5 times the maximum of the soft clause weights. 
(See the developer's manual on how to change the default prior weights.) 

<P>
When multiple databases are used, the CNF of a formula with existentially 
quantified variables or variables with mutually exclusive and exhaustive 
values may be different across the databases. This occurs because we have 
to ground the variables to constants that are different across the 
databases. When this happens, we learn a weight for the formula rather 
than for each clause in its CNF.

<P>
You can view all the options by typing <TT>ALCHDIR/bin/learnwts</TT> without 
any parameters. After weight learning, the output <TT>.mln</TT> file contains the 
weights of the original formulas (commented out), as well as those of 
its derived clauses.
