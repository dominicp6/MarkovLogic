4.2 MLN Syntax</A>
</H2>

<P>
For convenience, Alchemy provides three additional operators: 
<TT>*</TT>, <TT>+</TT> and <TT>!</TT>. When predicates in a formula are preceded 
by <TT>*</TT>, Alchemy considers all possible ways in which <TT>*</TT> can be 
replaced by <TT>!</TT>, e.g., <TT>*student(x) ^ *professor(x)</TT> is 
expanded into four formulas: 

<UL>
<LI><TT>student(x) ^ professor(x)</TT>
</LI>
<LI><TT>!student(x) ^ professor(x)</TT>
</LI>
<LI><TT>student(x) ^ !professor(x)</TT>
</LI>
<LI><TT>!student(x) ^ !professor(x)</TT>
</LI>
</UL>
This syntax allows you to compactly express a relational Markov 
network in Markov logic.

<P>
The <TT>+</TT> operator makes it possible to learn ``per constant'' weights. 
When a variable in a formula is preceded by <TT>+</TT>, a separate weight is 
learned for each formula obtained by grounding that variable to one of 
its values. For example, if the input formula is <TT>hasPosition(x,+y)</TT>, a 
separate weight is learned for the three formulas:

<UL>
<LI><TT>hasPosition(x,Faculty)</TT>
</LI>
<LI><TT>hasPosition(y,Faculty_adjunct)</TT>
</LI>
<LI><TT>hasPosition(y,Faculty_emeritus)</TT>
</LI>
</UL>
If multiple variables are preceded by <TT>+</TT>, a weight is learned for each 
combination of their values. When there are multiple databases, the type 
of the variable to which <TT>+</TT> is applied must have the same constants in 
all the databases. This ensures that the same formulas are generated for 
each database.

<P>
The <TT>!</TT> operator allows you to specify variables that have mutually 
exclusive and exhaustive values. For example, if the input formula is
<TT>hasPosition(x, y!)</TT>, this means that any person has exactly one position
(all groundings for this person build one block).
This constraint is enforced when performing inference and learning: it is
guaranteed that exactly one grounding per block is true.
Note that the <TT>!</TT> appears after a variable. <TT>!</TT> can only be used in a
formula with exactly one non-negated predicate, and can be applied to 
any number of the predicate's variables.

<P>
You can include comments in the <TT>.mln</TT> file with <TT>//</TT> 
and <TT>/* */</TT> like in C++.

<P>
The characters <TT>@</TT> and <TT>$</TT> are reserved and should not be used. Due to the
internal processing of functions, variable names should not start with <TT>funcVar</TT>
and predicate names should not start with <TT>isReturnValueOf</TT>.

<P>
A formula in an <TT>.mln</TT> file can be preceded by a number representing the
weight of the formula. A formula can also be terminated by a
period (<TT>.</TT>), indicating that it is a hard formula. 
However, a formula cannot have both a weight and a period. 
In a formula, you can have a line break after 
<TT>=&gt;</TT>, <TT>&lt;=&gt;</TT>, <TT>^</TT> and <TT>v</TT>.

<P>
A legal identifier is a sequence of alphanumeric characters plus the
characters <TT>-</TT> (hyphen), <TT>_</TT> (underscore), and <TT>'</TT> (prime); 
<TT>'</TT> cannot be the first character. Variables in formulas must begin with 
a lowercase letter, and constants must begin with an uppercase one. 
Constants may also be expressed as strings 
(e.g., <TT>Alice</TT> and <TT>&quot;A Course in Logic&quot;</TT> 
are both acceptable as constants).

<P>
Alchemy converts input formulas into CNF. This means that a conjunction of <IMG
 WIDTH="16" HEIGHT="19" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img2.png"
 ALT="$n$">
conjuncts in a formula results in <IMG
 WIDTH="16" HEIGHT="19" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img2.png"
 ALT="$n$"> formulas. In an effort to preserve the
original formula as much as possible, Alchemy keeps all single literals in a conjunction
together by negating the formula: the weight is negated and the formula becomes
a disjunction of the negated literals. For instance, the formula

<P>

<TT>2.5 P(x) ^ Q(x) ^ (R(x) v S(x))</TT>

<P>
results in the two formulas

<P>

<TT>-1.25 !P(x) v !Q(x)</TT> and

<P>

<TT>1.25 R(x) v S(x)</TT>.

<P>
In a future version of Alchemy, the user will be able to specify which parts
of a formula are indivisible.

<P>
Note that Alchemy does not use Skolemization to remove existential
quantifiers when converting a formula to CNF. Instead, it replaces
existentially quantified subformulas by disjunctions of all their
groundings. (Skolemization is sound for resolution, but not sound in
general.) For example, when there are only two constants <TT>Alice</TT> 
and <TT>Bob</TT>, the formula 
<TT>EXIST x,y advisedBy(x,y)</TT> becomes: <TT>advisedBy(Alice,Alice) v
advisedBy(Alice,Bob) v 
<BR>
advisedBy(Bob,Alice) v advisedBy(Bob,Bob)</TT>.
This may result in very large CNF formulas, and existential quantifiers
(or negated universal quantifiers) should be used with care.

<P>
Types and constants can be declared in an <TT>.mln</TT> file with the following 
syntax: <TT>&lt;typename&gt; = { &lt;constant1&gt;, &lt;constant2&gt;, ... }</TT>, 
e.g., <TT>person = { Alice, Bob }</TT>.  
You can also declare integer types, e.g., 
<TT>ageOfStudent = { 18, ..., 22 }</TT>.
You may have a line break between 
constants. Each declared type must have at least one constant. 
A constant is considered to be declared the first time it is 
encountered in a type declaration, a formula, or a ground atom 
(in a<TT>.db</TT> file). 

<P>
You can include other <TT>.mln</TT> files in a <TT>.mln</TT> file with the 
<TT>"#include" </TT> keyword. For example, you can include formulas about 
a university domain in your <TT>.mln</TT> file about a company domain with 
<TT>#include "university.mln"</TT>.

<P>
The executables will print out error messages when they encounter syntax 
or semantic errors. Each message will indicate the line and column number 
of the error (lines start from 1 and columns from 0). An error may not be 
exactly at the indicated column but near it, and an error may also be a 
result of previous ones (much like compiler error messages). 

<P>
Predicates and functions play a large role in Alchemy and this topic 
(including syntax) is covered extensively in the next section.
