Mar 15, 2006
------------
* Added support for linked-in and internally implemented predicates and
functions.

Mar 10, 2006
------------
* Fix a bug causing the weights of some ground clauses to be considered more
  than once when constructing the MRF for inference.
* Fix a bug affecting discriminative learning. It causes a ground predicate
  to be affected only by the weight of the first ground clause that contains it,
  when it should be affected by all the ground clauses that contain it.

Mar 7, 2006
-----------
* Bug fixes from the release from March 1st, which was not packaged correctly.

Mar 1, 2006
-----------
* Support for functions in Markov Logic Networks.
* Fix a bug in learnwts/votedperceptron.h. Previously, the code did not set 
  all the non-evidence atoms to UNKNOWN in the database before constructing the
  MRF. Now, it does.

Feb 13, 2006
------------
* Fix a bug in structure learning that occasionally prevents a clause in an MLN 
  from being replaced with a longer/shorter one.

Feb 4, 2006
-----------
* Fix a bug causing a negated equality predicate (e.g., !(a=b)) to give a parse
  error.

Jan 29, 2006
------------
* The conditional log-likelihood of the equality predicate ('=') is no longer
  included in the pseudo-log-likelihood during weight learning. 

Jan 24, 2006
------------
* Formatted the printing of clauses so that equality predicates appear at the
  end.

Jan 23, 2006
------------
* Allow the equality predicate ('=') to be added during structure learning
(e.g., person(a) v person(b) v a = b).

Jan 12, 2006
------------
* Allow a formula weight in scientific notation to have an explicit positive 
  exponent e.g. 1.0e+2.

Jan 10, 2006
------------
* In a Gibbs pass during inference, when we sample the value of a ground atom, 
  we used the values of the ground atoms in its Markov blanket in the previous
  Gibbs pass. Now we use the values in the current Gibbs pass.

* When counting the number of true groundings of a clause, its literals are 
  now sorted in decreasing (rather than increasing) order of their fraction of
  true groundings. This change may speed up the counting.

Jan 5, 2006
-----------
* Previously, when drawing the first sample during inference, the probability 
  that a ground atom is true is set to 0.5 independent of its Markov blanket.
  Now that probability is set to a value that is dependent on its Markov 
  blanket.

Dec 30, 2005
------------
* Previously, during inference, when an undeclared constant appeared in a query
  predicate, we gave an error message, ignored the constant and proceeded with
  the inference. Now we halt the program after the error message.

* Fix the bug in which the terms of a formula containing only conjunctions
  are not tied.

Dec 27, 2005
------------
* Previously, during inference, when neither -c or -o was specified, 
  all predicates other than the query ones were closed world. Now the 
  predicates are open-world by default.

Dec 22, 2005
------------
* During inference, a unit formula containing variables with mutually exclusive
  and exhaustive values is now allowed to be neither preceded by a weight nor
  terminated by a period in a .mln file.

* The type of a variable that is marked with the '+' operator no longer needs
  to have its constants appear in the same order across multiple databases.
