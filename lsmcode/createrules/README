createrules creates clauses and retains those with high enough pseudo-loglikelihood (with respect to their sub-clauses)

PARAMS
candFile        = file containing rules (output of pfind), e.g., myRules.rules
minSup          = minimum number of motifs supporting a rule in order for it to be considered
dbFiles         = comma-separated databases, e.g., myDB1.db,myDB2.db
combLDBFile     = comma-separated files containing motifs, e.g., myMotifs1.comb.ldb,myMotifs2.comb.ldb (same number as dbFiles)
unmergeLDBFiles = comma-separated files containing ground hypergraph supporting motifs, e.g., myHGraph1.uldb,myHGraph2.uldb
                  (same number as dbFiles)
declFile        = file containing predicate declaration (same as for rwl)
learnWtsExec    = path to alchemy's learnwt executable
tmpDir          = temporary directory for createrules to write working files (parallel runs should have different tmpDirs)
fractAtoms      = fraction of atoms to sample from dbFiles
lenPenalty      = penalty on pseudo-loglikelihood per atom (pi parameter mentioned in paper)
quickLenPenalty = penalty per atom when using heuristic (see paper)
numFlips        = number of atoms to flip in creating clauses
maxLen          = maximum length of clauses
minAtoms        = minimum atoms to sample when using heuristic
maxAtoms        = maximum atoms to sample when using heuristic
numQuickPruneDBs= set to the number of databases in dbFiles
outMLN          = output MLN containing rules
seed            = seed for random number generator
trivialBinFile  = file containing binary clauses that are always true/false (one per line), e.g.,
                  !SameTitle(0,1) v SameTitle(1,0)
                  !SameAuthor(0,1) v SameAuthor(1,0)
                  If this file is not specified (use a -), then the clauses will be discovered automatically.
symRelFile      = file containing symmetric predicates, e.g.,
                  SameTitle
                  SameAuthor
                  If this file is not specified (use a -), then the predicates will be discovered automatically.
cfAllSub        = set to true
cora            = set to false
                  When this is set to true, alchemy's learnwts only optimizes the SameX's predicates for the Cora dataset.
                  See cora_ in mlncreator.h for how this is used.               
noQuickPrune    = set to false
