class HierarchicalClusterer(object):
    """
    A class to perform hierarchical clustering on either a weighted, undirected graph
    or a weighted, undirected hypergraph.

    -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    If clustering on a graph we use the MakeTree algorithm and spectral bi-partitioning based
    on the eigenvalues of the random walk Laplacian matrix:

    -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    If clustering on a hypergraph we use the MakeTree algorithm and the Normalized Hypergraph
    Cut algorithm for hypergraphs, a generalization of the graph-based spectral bi-partitioning
    algorithm:

    GENERIC PARAMETERS:
    :param stop_criterion: specifies the stop criterion for when to stop clustering. The options are:
                           'eigenvalue' - stop partitioning a cluster when the value of the second

                           'cluster_size' - stop partitioning a cluster when the number of nodes in
                                          the partitioned cluster would below a specified size

                               clustering tree from which to output the final node clusters, e.g. height of 0
                               would output only leaf nodes.
    :param min_cluster_size (int): [Only if stop criterion is 'cluster_size'] The minimum cluster size

                    with different centroid seeds. The final result will be the best output of
                    n_init consecutive runs in terms of inertia (default 10)
    :param max_iter (int): [K-means hyperparameter] The maximum number of iterations of the k-means algorithm
                    for a single run (default 300)

    PARAMETERS FOR HIERARCHICAL CLUSTERING OF HYPERGRAPHS
    :param threshold (float): The second smallest eigenvalue threshold value for the Normalized Hypergraph Cut
                              algorithm.
