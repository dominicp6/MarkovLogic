class HierarchicalClusterer(object):
    """
    To perform hierarchical clustering of a hypergraph.

    Example usage:
        HC = HierarchicalClusterer(hypergraph, config = {'min_cluster_size' : 5, 'max_lambda2' : 0.8})
        hypergraph_clusters = HC.hierarchical_clustering()

    The steps are:
    1. Convert the hypergraph into a graph by replacing each n-hyperedge with an n-clique.
    2. Recursively bi-partition the graph into smaller graphs using the Cheeger-Cut algorithm. Stop partitioning when
       a terminating condition is met (either because graph is split too small, or because the size of the second
       smallest Laplacian eigenvalue exceeds a threshold). This produces a hierarchical binary tree of graph objects.
    3. Convert the graphs from the leaf nodes of the tree into hypergraphs using the original hypergraph as a template.
       Return the list of hypergraphs.

    Configuration parameters (to specify stop criteria):
        min_cluster_size (int) - the smallest size (number of nodes) of the final graphs that are permitted.
        max_lambda2 (float in interval 0-2)    - the largest value of the second smallest eigenvalue of the graph's
                                 laplacian matrix permitted (due to the Cheeger-inequality, larger values of lambda2
                                  signify that it is more challenging to find a sparse-cut for the graph)
