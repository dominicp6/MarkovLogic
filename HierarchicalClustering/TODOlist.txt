Put code for reading info file into EnhancedHypergraph [DONE]

Include node_type_to_constant node map [DONE]

Modify EnhancedHypergraph to include typed node objects [DONE]

Add runRandomWalks method to EnhancedHypergraph (takes in config) [DONE]

Create Node class (extends entity) with appropriate methods  [DONE]
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Identify how to get the matrix representation of the hypergraph

Design choice: hypergraph.get_random_neighbour(node) or node.get_random_neighbour(hypergraph)

Implement the random walk function. Improve the JS divergence code.

Cythonise the file.

writeDatabaseToFile and writeSourceNodeToFile functions instead of Community printer? [CHECK THIS!]

Incorporate smart hyperedge adding

[Easy] Incorporate community 'pruning' for nodes which appeared twice (select smallest community?)
[Hard] Or.. incorporate method that uses the hierarchical nature of the clustering to identify a parent cluster to
look for communities in...
